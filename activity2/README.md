# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Why is Algorithm Analysis Important?
  the answer: it is important because we should always choose the best possible solution of any task (with the least amount of the time/effort/energy/budget involved) cause the amount of resources involved into the solution search is important also for efficient business running.
- Explain the Big $O$ notation
  the answer: it is the important and pretty good mechanism of analyzing the algorithms.
  It signifies the relationship between the input to the algorithm and the steps required to execute it. the relationship between the input and the steps taken by the algorithm is presented using "n".
  The most important is that Big-O isn't interested in a particular instance in which you run an algorithm, but in how well does it scale given increasing input. This is a much better metric for evaluating than concrete time for a concrete instance!
- Compare `Linear`, `Logarithmic`, `Quadratic` and `Constant` complexities.
  the answer:
  Linear complexity is okay, Logarithmic is better than linear, but worse than constant. Constant is the best in the list.
  and quadratic is the worst in the list.

## Task2

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple algorithm in C++ that finds the square of the first item in a list and then prints it on the screen.
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?

## Task 3

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple program that displays all items in a list to the console.
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?

## Task 4: : Individual, at home

Refer to this [pdf](./big_o.pdf):

- What is the difference between complexity and performance:
  the answer:
  Performance: how much time/memory/disk/... is actually used when a program is
  run. This depends on the machine, compiler, etc. as well as the code.  
  Complexity: how do the resource requirements of a program or algorithm scale,
  i.e., what happens as the size of the problem being solved gets larger?
- Does complexity affects performance bor is it the other way around?
  the answer: Complexity affects performance but not the other way around.
- Restate the formal definition of big $O$ in plain English
  the answer: Big O is a symbolism used in complexity theory, computer science, and mathematics to describe the asymptotic behavior of functions. Basically, it tells you how fast a function grows or declines.
